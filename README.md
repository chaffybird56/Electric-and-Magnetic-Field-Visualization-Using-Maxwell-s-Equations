This project simulates and visualizes the electric and magnetic fields generated by a plane electromagnetic wave, applying Maxwellâ€™s Equations in free space. Using MATLAB, the code creates a 3D plot that represents the electric field \mathbf{E} and magnetic field \mathbf{B} vectors as they propagate through space. 
This project helps to illustrate fundamental electromagnetic wave properties, particularly the orthogonal relationship between \mathbf{E}, \mathbf{B}, and the direction of wave propagation.
